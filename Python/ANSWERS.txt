Section 4 - Area Calculator

Use a float instead of integer with your input function. 

length = float(input(Please enter the LENGTH of your rectangle: "))
width = float(input("Please enter the WIDTH of your rectangle: "))

Then you can accept decimals instead of just whole numbers which certianly captures more of our imperfect world. 
You could also add units to the print statements to be more specific.
