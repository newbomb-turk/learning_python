###INTRO###
Welcome to the fun Python Folder! 

This folder contains many scripts and mini programs that I feel cover pretty much anything Python one person could need to start coding with it. 
I would NOT reccomend just running these scripts and observing output. 

You will NOT learn anything by just running these files. You MUST read and interact with the code! 

The idea behind this folder was to be able to search something you may do right now in another language (such as ksh, bash, perl, or even Java) and learn how to do it in Python. 

If you are entirely new to Python or even coding in general, then I would reccomend starting at Section 1 and working your way through. 
I encourge everyone to copy these scripts and modify them on their own. 
Add to them, tear them down. Do what you need to do to learn or what you feel fits your project and experience. 

At the very least, modify every project to your own Name, info, and interests. All of mine below are junk. (:

For the most part, each section builds off the last one. But they are not prerequisties as some code from previous sections will be included in newer ones. 
Some sections have intentional bad code too. 
If you search and get lost, Go back section by section until something sounds familiar. 

And again - All of these folders *should* be searchable.
The file names under the folders will mostly just be main.py.



###HOW TO USE INTERACTIVELY###
I made this folder using VS Code and the defeault Python extenstion. 

#VS Code - Native but more complex. 

Install VS Code. It is free and approved. 
Once installed, open the app.
Navigate to extenions on the left. 

Search Python. 

It should be the most installed extension. 
And also the top result. I always check number of downloads and uploader link. 

Once the extension is installed

Go to File in top left of VS Code, Open Folder -> This Python folder.


#PyCharm - Easier, not a great debugger. Less robust than VS Code overall. 

Install the COMMUNITY VERSION of PyCharm. 
This version is free. The other version is $99...

Once installed, just open Folder or "Workspace" -> This Python folder. 


Have fun!
